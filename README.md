# Audio Buddy

A small Windows desktop app for building a service (setlist) order. Add songs, pick the key each one is being sung in, and assign who's leading it. The master song list, default keys, and leader names come from an online Google Sheet.

## Setting up the Google Sheet

1. Create a Google Sheet with **two tabs**:

   **Tab `Songs`** — header row, then one song per row. The Length column (m:ss) is optional and drives the now-playing countdown; the BPM column (column D) is optional and shows in search results, the row editor and the now-playing panel:

   | Song Name | Default Key | Length | BPM |
   |-----------|-------------|--------|-----|
   | Great Are You Lord | G | 5:30 | 72 |
   | Oceans | D | 8:55 | 64 |

   **Tab `Leaders`** — header row, then one name per row:

   | Leader Name |
   |-------------|
   | Sarah |
   | Mike |

2. Share it so the app can read it: **Share → General access → "Anyone with the link" → Viewer**. No sign-in or API key is needed.

3. Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the sheet's URL — it's the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`:

   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/  THIS_PART_IS_THE_ID  /edit#gid=0
   ```

4. In the app, click **Settings** and paste the ID (or simply the whole sheet URL — the app pulls the ID out of it), then **Save & sync**. If you named the tabs something else, change the tab names there too.

   Settings are stored in `appsettings.json` next to `Audio Buddy.exe`, so you can also edit that file directly:

   ```json
   {
     "SpreadsheetId": "PUT_ID_HERE",
     "SongsTab": "Songs",
     "LeadersTab": "Leaders",
     "TimecodeDevice": ""
   }
   ```

## Running

Double-click `Audio Buddy.exe` (with `appsettings.json` next to it). On launch it pulls both tabs; **Refresh** re-pulls on demand. Every sync also updates the Length and BPM of songs already in the service from the sheet — no need to re-add a song after fixing its timestamp. If there's no internet, it keeps working from the last successful pull and shows *"Using cached list — last synced …"* in the status line.

### Using the app

- **Search box** — type part of a song name; Enter adds the top match (or pick from the list) with its default key filled in.
- **+ Add manually** — for a song that isn't in the sheet (added to this service only, never written back to the sheet).
- **Rows at a glance** — each row shows the song, its key (with the enharmonic spelling, e.g. `F# (= Gb)`) and the leader as plain text.
- **✎ (pencil)** — opens the row's inline editor: key dropdown (majors and minors — `Gm`, `F#m`, …), leader dropdown (pick from the sheet or type a new name), a BPM box, and a colour strip to colour-code the song. Click ✓ to close.
- **Drag a song's name** to reorder; click the name to grey it out as completed. **✕** removes a row, or right-click any row for edit/remove.
- **Small windows** — the layout adapts: below ~760 px wide the rows go compact (name + key, actions via right-click); below ~450 px tall the top bar folds into a ☰ menu.
- **▶** — marks a song as now playing: a countdown of its Length runs under the timecode (locked to LTC when timecode is running, wall clock otherwise), with the song's BPM shown under its name. Click again to stop.
- The window reopens at the size and position you left it (per machine, stored in `%APPDATA%\NovaSetlist\window.json`).
- **Copy as text** — puts a clean plain-text order on the clipboard, e.g. `1. Song Name — Key G — Leader: Sarah`.
- **New service** — clears the list (asks first).
- **Settings** — set the spreadsheet ID / tab names from inside the app.
- **Settings → About** — software details, version number, and a **Check for updates** button.

### Timecode viewer

The panel on the right decodes **SMPTE LTC** from any WDM audio input and shows it live (same decoder as the Timecode Bridge — framerate autodetect incl. 29.97 drop-frame, works from very low line levels). Pick the input in **Settings → Audio inputs**; the choice is remembered. SIGNAL lights green when LTC cadence is detected, LOCK when two consecutive frames have decoded cleanly. View-only — nothing is retransmitted.

### Live key detection

Give it a second WDM input carrying the band / music feed (Settings → Audio inputs → Key detection) and the panel shows the key being played, updated as the music moves. It listens to a few seconds of harmonic context, so give it a moment after a key change; it shows "listening…" instead of guessing when it isn't confident. A feed with bass in it works best — the bass carries the tonality.

### SPL meter

The bottom of the side panel shows a live **SPL(A)** reading (IEC A-weighting, Slow 1 s or Fast 125 ms response) from a measurement-mic input picked in **Settings → SPL meter**. Calibrate it against a reference SPL meter with the **calibration offset** — type a value or trim with the −1 dB / +1 dB buttons; the offset applies live while the Settings window is open, so you can dial it in as you watch both meters. **Colour zones** recolour the number as the room gets louder: green until the yellow level, then yellow, then red. Untick "Show a live SPL(A) meter" to hide the section entirely.

The current service auto-saves on every change (`%APPDATA%\NovaSetlist\current.json`) and is restored when the app reopens.

## Updates

New versions are published as [GitHub releases](https://github.com/DavidPujals/audio-buddy/releases). Inside the app, **Settings → About → Check for updates** compares the running version against the latest release; if there's a newer one it downloads it and swaps the exe in place — click **Restart now** to finish. Your `appsettings.json` and saved service are untouched by updates.

### Cutting a release (maintainers)

1. Bump `<Version>` in `NovaSetlist/NovaSetlist.csproj` (e.g. `1.5.0`).
2. Publish (command below), then upload the exe under the asset name `AudioBuddy.exe`:

   ```
   gh release create v1.5.0 "AudioBuddy.exe" --title "v1.5.0" --notes "What changed"
   ```

   The tag (`v1.5.0`) must match the csproj version — the in-app updater compares them. Keep exactly one `.exe` asset per release: installs older than the rename look for the previous asset name and fall back to the first `.exe` they find.

## Building from source

Requires the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

```
dotnet build          # build
dotnet run --project NovaSetlist   # run from source
```

To publish a self-contained single-file exe for Windows x64 (no .NET install needed on the target machine):

```
dotnet publish NovaSetlist\NovaSetlist.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true -o dist
```

The result is `dist\Audio Buddy.exe`. Settings live in `appsettings.json` next to the exe — the app creates it when you save Settings, and republishing never overwrites an existing one.
